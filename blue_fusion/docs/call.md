# The Contest ...

... exploiting the complementary properties of SAR and optical ...

... for all-weather land-cover and building damage mapping using multimodal SAR and optical EO data at submeter resolution. ... two tracks focusing on 1Ô∏è‚É£ land cover types and 2Ô∏è‚É£ building damage ... two main technical challenges: 1Ô∏è‚É£ effective integration of multimodal data and 2Ô∏è‚É£ handling of noisy labels.

# Track 1: ...Land Cover Mapping

... land cover mapping ... using SAR ... training data ... multimodal submeter-resolution optical and SAR images with 8-class land cover labels ... derived from optical images based on pre-trained models ... mIoU metric.

# Track 2: ... Building Damage Mapping

... assessing building damage using bi-temporal multimodal images ... training data ... optical images from before the disaster and SAR images after the disaster, all at submeter resolution, labeled with four classes: background, intact, damaged, and destroyed buildings ... mIoU metric.

# ... Phases

... two phases:

1Ô∏è‚É£ ... Development phase ... training data and additional validation images (without any corresponding reference data) ... Participants can submit prediction results for the validation set to ... Codalab competition ... to get feedback. ... leaderboard 

2Ô∏è‚É£ ... receive the test data set ... and submit their results within five days ...
